Description: Implements EM-based joint models linking a longitudinal outcome with two correlated time-to-event endpoints through shared random effects. The dependence between survival endpoints is modeled using a Clayton survival copula. The package supports Gaussian and Poisson longitudinal submodels and accommodates one- or two-dimensional random effects. Example datasets are shipped with the package.
